Some more details: I ended up performing these steps to match out of the box eclipse organizing:

(in settings > code style > java > imports, as mentioned by @yole)

set "class count to use import with '*'" to 99 (seems like you cannot turn this off)
set this ordering (like eclipse defaults):
static all other,
blank,
java.*,
blank,
javax.*,
blank,
org.*,
blank,
com.*,
blank,
all other imports
